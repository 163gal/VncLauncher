What is this?
=============

This activity helps you broadcast your screen to another computer. It will automatically launch a VNC server (X11vnc) and display your IP address. You can then connect and view the screen of Sugar on another conmputer using any VNC client (e.g. TigerVNC, UltraVNC Viewer, RealVNC, etc).

How to use?
